## Internet Explorer 11 support

These JavaScript features are used in react-streamfield that are not supported
natively in Internet Explorer 11: 

- `Element.closest(…)`
- `Array.find(…)`
- `Object.entries(…)`
- `CustomEvent`

When using react-streamfield for Internet Explorer 11, you need to include
the polyfills found in the section below, otherwise the package will not work
properly.


## Polyfills

React-streamfield uses some JavaScript features only available starting
ECMAScript 2015. Some of these features are not handled by browsers such as
Internet Explorer 11.

To maintain compatibility when using react-streamfield, install and import
these polyfills (a polyfill adds a missing JavaScript browser feature):

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "core-js": "^2.6.5",
    "element-closest": "^3.0.1",
    "custom-event-polyfill": "^1.0.6"
  }
}
```

```javascript
import 'core-js/shim'
import 'element-closest';
import 'custom-event-polyfill';
```
